  - Acute on chronic respiratory failure: `J96.2x` (specify hypoxemic vs hypercapnic if coded)

- **adt**: `hospitalization_id`, `in_dttm`, `out_dttm`, `location_category`, `location_type`

**Severity and patient profiles**
- **patient_assessments**: `hospitalization_id`, `recorded_dttm`, `assessment_category`, `numerical_value`
  - Used for `gcs_total` in SOFA CNS scoring.
- **hospital_diagnosis**: used for Charlson comorbidity components and weighted Charlson score.
- **medication_admin_continuous**: used for SOFA cardiovascular scoring from vasoactive infusion dose.

**Control cohort (perioperative respiratory failure)**
- ICD-10 `J95.82`: Acute pulmonary insufficiency following thoracic surgery  
- ICD-10 `J95.83`: Acute pulmonary insufficiency following nonthoracic surgery  
- ICD-10 `J95.84`: Acute and chronic respiratory failure following surgery

## Cohort identification

**Inclusion criteria**:

1.  Adult patients (≥18 years) admitted to ICU between 2018–2024.

2.  At least one of the following criteria of acute respiratory failure
    is met:

    -   Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (any one of the following)

        -   SpO2 less than 90% on room air

        -   PaO2 of 60 mm Hg or less on room air

        -   PaO2–FiO2 ratio of 300 or less (on any amount of FiO2)

    -   Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (both of the following)

        -   PaCO2 of 45 mm Hg or more AND

        -   Arterial pH \< 7.35

3.  Available ABG and/or continuous pulse oximetry data within ±24h of
    ICU admission.

4.  Residential census tract and county code for environmental data linkage.

***-\> Note that mixed hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure is
common and should be accounted for.***

***-\> Also note that for SpO2 and PaO2, these numbers are directly
affected by supplemental oxygen (FiO2) via whatever delivery mechanism.
The definitions for ARF we choose for these values will be on room air
(21% FiO2). P/F ratio can define ARF even on supplemental oxygen.***

**Exclusion criteria** 
- Missing key demographic data (age, sex, race). 
- Hospitalizations \<24 hours in ICU. 
- Repeat ICU stays within same hospitalization (only first considered for primary analysis).

## Current Analysis Direction

The current site-facing analysis is a CLIF federated workflow for early ARF trajectory phenotyping. The primary analysis cohort is adult ICU hospitalizations with first evidence of ARF during the ICU stay, including hypoxemia, impaired gas exchange, hypercapnic acidosis, or advanced respiratory support. IMV-only and advanced respiratory support cohorts are retained as sensitivity analyses.

Trajectory phenotypes are built over the first 72 hours after ARF onset using dynamic time warping and CLIF/mCIDE-aligned respiratory support, oxygenation, ventilation, acid-base, and lung-injury biomarker features. Environmental exposures are linked locally by county and admission date, then evaluated through site-level models that can be pooled centrally without exporting patient-level clinical data.

See [docs/CLIF_FEDERATED_ANALYSIS_PLAN.md](docs/CLIF_FEDERATED_ANALYSIS_PLAN.md) for the planned federated analysis design.

## Detailed Instructions for running the project

## 1. Update `config/config.json`

Follow instructions in the [config/README.md](config/README.md) file for detailed configuration steps.

## 2. Set up the project environment

Initialize the R environment. Run `00_renv_restore.R` in the [code](code) directory to set up the project environment.

Unzip the `acs_estimates.csv.zip` file in the exposome folder and save it there.

## 3. Run code

Detailed instructions on the current code workflow are provided in the [code directory](code/README.md).

Current canonical scripts:

1. `code/01_cohort_identification.R`
2. `code/02_trajectories.R`
3. `code/03_patient_profiles.R`

Older exploratory scripts are preserved in `code/archive/` for provenance but are not current entry points.
