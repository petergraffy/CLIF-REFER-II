 ## Code directory

This directory contains scripts for the project workflow. The general workflow consists of two main steps: cohort identification, and linkage/analysis.

### General Workflow

0. First, initialize your R environment using `00_renv_restore`.

1. Run the `01_REFER_cohort_identification.R` script. **Before running this script, be sure to edit line 51 with your working directory path that is the repo root directory**.
   This script should:
   - Apply inclusion and exclusion criteria
   - Select required fields from each table
   - Produce a CONSORT-style diagram for patient selection
   - Set up for the analysis script
   
Then, **without making any changes to your R environment**, you can run the next step immediately after.

2. Run the `02_REFER_linkage_analysis.R` script
   This script should:
   - Perform project-specific quality control checks on the filtered cohort data.
   - Perform geospatial linkage to exposome features in the accompanied csv files.
   - Perform modeling and return outputs and figures.

If you accidentally cleared your environment between steps, you can run step 1 again to get the objects back in your environment, or you can re-read the saved csv output from file one in the output folder.

**Once all code has been run, upload the entire output folder as-is to Box.**
